      lorri is a nix-shell replacement for project development. lorri is based
      around fast direnv integration for robust CLI and editor integration.

      The project is about experimenting with and improving the developer's
      experience with Nix. A particular focus is managing your project's
      external dependencies, editor integration, and quick feedback.
